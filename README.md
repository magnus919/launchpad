# launchpad
Quick-start configurations for homelab.

I wanted a place to start sharing the `docker-compose.yml` files that I've been crafting for my own homelab. My intent is to go through them, clean them up, and make them more consumable for others here.

This is inspired by [techno-tim/launchpad](https://github.com/techno-tim/launchpad).
